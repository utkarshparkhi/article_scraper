Introduction
The Realme 8 5G is another one of the maker's odd sequels. It appears as if it's meant to be the successor to the Realme 7 5G, and yet it has a few downgrades. But there is a good reason for that - it aims to be the cheapest 5G phone in the world. 

Besides its 5G claim, the Realme 8 5G is one very balanced entry-level smartphone. It offers a 90Hz 1080p LCD screen, a capable Dimensity 700 5G chip, there is a triple-camera on the back, a 5,000mAh battery with 18W charging, and all of these come wrapped in a beautiful body.
The Realme 8 5G is priced €179 for the early birds, while its official price tag is €199. That's indeed cheap, notably cheaper than the €279 Realme 7 5G. Obviously, some features had to go.

The Realme 8 5G has a 90Hz screen and Dimensity 700 with 64GB base storage, while the previous model had a 120Hz display and the Dimensity 800U chip with a bit more powerful GPU and 128GB base memory. The Realme 7 5G also had an additional 8MP ultrawide camera, water-sealed ports, and Gorilla Glass protection. Well, those things are gone, now.
Anyway, the 5G era is upon us and 5G phones will become desirable sooner rather than later, so we can understand Realme's early attack on the budget segment. It is the market that probably sells the most phones. And the Realme 8 5G, even with the cutbacks, seems like one balanced smartphone.

We would have liked to keep at least the water-sealed ports and the Gorilla Glass, but no can do, obviously. Well, it is what it is, and at that price - we guess it's understandable. So, without further ado - let's unbox this thing.
Unboxing the Realme 8 5G
The Realme 8 5G comes in one of the maker's signature yellow boxes. Inside you'll find an 18W power adapter, a USB-C cable, and a soft transparent case.

The phone also has a factory pre-applied protective film, but we got rid of that fast - it's quite easy to get smudged up.
summary: The Realme 8 5G has an all-screen flat font, a thin plastic frame, and a dazzling curved back with this subtle radiant light effect. It was one unnecessary large and flashy logo, which was getting in the way of the good looks, at least in our opinion. The camera glass is unusually large and jutting out a lot, even if it contains one proper camera.
 oneliner: The Realme 8 5G is the latest budget smartphone from India's Realme Group, and it's a pretty good one.
 
Design, build, handling
The Realme 8 5G looks like many of the recent Realme budget phones - it has an all-screen flat font, a thin plastic frame, and a dazzling curved back with this subtle radiant light effect.

Realme finally decided on dropping the Dare to Leap insignia and we cannot be happier. It was one unnecessary large and flashy logo, which was getting in the way of the good looks, at least in our opinion.
One thing that's also gone on the Realme 8 5G is the water seals around the ports - there is no ingress protection whatsoever on this new phone, at least according to the official specs. And while the Realme 7 5G had a Gorilla Glass shielding the screen, the 8 5G glass is not advertised as Corning-made.

So, the front is a home of the 6.5" IPS LCD 1080p screen. It has the usual rounded edges and features a punch-hole for the 16MP selfie camera. The black dot isn't the tiniest we've seen, but we hope the selfie camera will be worth the sacrificed pixels.

The bottom bezel is rather thick but perfectly acceptable for this segment. The top bezel houses the earpiece grille.
The rear panel is made of plastic, though it looks a lot like glass thanks to the multi-layered design, which creates the radiant light effect. We have the Supersonic Blue model here, looking really good, and while the glossy back gets all sorts of smudges, they aren't as visible as they would have been on the black version.

The camera glass is unusually large and jutting out a lot, even if it contains one proper camera - the 48MP primary shooter. There is a pair of 2MP snappers - one macro and one depth sensor, and the fourth dot is an almost invisible AI logo. A LED flash is also present - it's a single piece even if its size may suggest otherwise.

The frame is made of plastic, it is mostly flat and has a cool matte finish making it grippy enough. There is nothing on the top part of the frame, while the bottom contains the 3.5mm jack, the mouthpiece, the USB-C port, and the loudspeaker.

The left side of the Realme 8 5G houses the tri-card slot and the volume rocker. Yes, you get Dual SIM functionality plus a microSD card.

The right part has the lone power key, also doubling as a fingerprint scanner. If you are troubled by its occasional triggering, you may want to change its activation from Touch to Press, and all of your issues will be gone in a flash.

The Realme 8 5G measures 162.5 x 74.8 x 8.5 mm - that makes it a hair thinner than the Realme 7 5G. It weighs 185 grams, 10g lighter than the previous model.
The Realme 8 5G is easy to handle, and its frame provides enough grip so it can be used without cases. The glossy back is a massive fingerprint magnet though the bright blue version is hiding that rather well. It's a reasonably sized smartphone, fits well in hand and pockets, and our only complaint is for the lack of any sort of splash resistance.
