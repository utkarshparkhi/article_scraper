summary: Sony Ericsson K850, Nokia N95 8GB, LG KU990 Viewty, and Samsung G600. We'll also be including a guest star - the Nokia N82, for one of our tests. All handsets are final retail versions, so odds are they will put their best effort.
 oneliner: You may or may not remember our teaser article or more of a blindfold test in which we presented you sample photos produced by the competing cameraphones.
 
No catch here, we've finally managed to finish up our grandest of camera shootouts including the most popular 5 megapixel cameraphones that are currently on sale. We've put Sony Ericsson K850, Nokia N95 8GB, LG KU990 Viewty, and Samsung G600 in a head-to-head collision course in order to find out who's best when it comes to pure camera-centric performance.  We'll also be including a guest star - the Nokia N82, for one of our tests - as it produces the same shots as the Nokia N95 8GB,  the only difference being the xenon flash.





Samsung G600 • LG KU990 Viewty • Nokia N95 8GB • Sony Ericsson K850 • Nokia N82
You may or may not remember our teaser article or more of a blindfold test in which we presented you sample photos produced by the competing cameraphones without disclosing their identity. We had our visitors vote for choosing the best one among them with all brand prejudice aside. We got some interesting results there that didn't quite match our view on the matter. The Nokia N95 8GB came first, Samsung G600 was chosen in second place, followed by LG Viewty and the last place was taken by Sony Ericsson K850.
While we do agree that Nokia N95 8GB is superior in image quality, we will try to convince you that Sony Ericsson K850 and the LG Viewty are not that bad and that Samsung G600 is not that good as perceived by our visitors. 



Our 5 megapixel shootout main contenders
All the basics
There are some points to be made before we jump to the details of our in-depth camera review. 
We want to point out that all the handsets we've used in this shootout are final retail versions, so odds are they will put their best effort to all make a run for the gold. 
Then, unless stated otherwise, all camera settings are left on auto, while the resolution selected is 5 megapixels and quality is set at its highest level. We decided using the full auto mode for shooting since most users shoot photos with their phones set on auto.
For some of the test samples we've also included photos taken with a digital camera - the Canon A620.  We chose to use a consumer digital camera as a reference instead of a DSLR for two reasons.
First, it's easier to frame the shots the same way, because the consumer digital cameras have the same 4:3 aspect ratio as the cameraphones.
Secondly, the DSLR results will be really different from those of the reviewed cameraphones. The DSLR-s cameras are tuned to preserve as much image information as possible and this is why they are too conservative for such a comparison. The consumer cameras, like Canon A620 in most cases add some punch to the photos, just enough for the images to be more lively and more likeable. It's easy to see that cameraphones try to do the same - produce images, which are pleasant and vivid.
Oh, and one more point - you're probably wondering why the heck we haven't included the Nokia N82 and the Samsung G800 as fully-fledged contenders. Well, for one the Nokia N82 produces exactly the same photos as the Nokia N95 8GB as we managed to personally confirm. There is the added benefit of a xenon flash, of course, but we'll take that into account - the Nokia N82 will be standing its ground in the flash comparison.
And for two, the Samsung G800 just wasn't available in the office at the time we did the test shots, but we have a pretty good idea of what it's capable of. So you will see the Samsung G800 mentioned here and there.
Probably we should also mention what camera shootouts are all about. There are several important factors that determine camera image quality and we will structure our article accordingly.
Breaking down the image quality we look for resolved detail, dynamic range, color accuracy, internal image processing and lens quality.
But there's more to a camera than image quality. It's really important how the camera software handles exposure, auto focus, shooting in low light, and shooting up-close macro photos. 
There are some extra goodies of a camera that also get tested in our shootout such as the value-adding features, the flash performance and the pure speed of the process of taking photos from A to Z.
And since we do more with a cameraphone than just take pictures, we also evaluate the video capturing capabilities of our contestants plus their multimedia galleries used for browsing all the images taken with the camera.
As you see there's a lot to write about, so bear with us and join us after this very break.
summary: We've spent a lot of time looking at the images at different magnifications on the screen and it's still hard to announce a clear winner here. The main obstacle here is the amount of sharpness applied in the post processing, which can easily be mistaken as detail. By far, the worst performer here is Samsung G600. There is not a big difference among the other three, but our opinion Nokia N95 performs slightly better than Viewty and K850.
 oneliner: Samsung G600, LG Viewty, Sony Ericsson K850 and Nokia N95 are all competing for the title of the world's best smartphone camera.

Resolved detail
We've spent a lot of time looking at the images at different magnifications on the screen and it's still hard to announce a clear winner here. The main obstacle here is the amount of sharpness applied in the post processing, which can easily be mistaken as detail.



Some of you might not agree, but we think that Samsung G600 delivers slightly less details than the rest, while Nokia N95 delivers slightly more. Anyway, the results are pretty close to a tie.
Samsung G600: 5/10 • LG Viewty: 6/10 • Nokia N95 8GB: 7/10 • Sony Ericsson K850: 6/10
Dynamic range
The dynamic range is a very important aspect of the photo quality of each camera. There is no way to fix the blown highlights (the parts of the image that have turned white), which are the most prominent result of the limited dynamic range. 


By far, the worst performer here is Samsung G600. We are not sure if this is because of an inferior sensor used, or because of the artificially high contrast applied in the post processing, but G600 loses more details in the highlights than the other contenders. There is not a big difference among the other three, but our opinion Nokia N95 performs slightly better than Viewty and K850.
Samsung G600: 2/10 • LG Viewty: 5/10 • Nokia N95 8GB: 6/10 • Sony Ericsson K850: 5/10
Color accuracy
We will use our Canon A620 samples to judge the color accuracy of the 5 megapixel contenders. As we've already mentioned A620 is not the most accurate camera in terms of color representation, but it's pretty close to what the consumer wants - pleasant and vivid images.

In most of the samples, Nokia N95 8GB is closer to A620 than the rest of the phones. Samsung G600 comes second, but while it masters the hue, it oversaturates the general colorfulness of the image (otherwise known as chroma). 
Sony Ericsson K850 and LG Viewty are on par with each other, but compared to Canon A620, their results are too red - an effect, which is a little more pronounced in Viewty.
Samsung G600: 6/10 • LG Viewty: 3/10 • Nokia N95 8GB: 7/10 • Sony Ericsson K850: 4/10
Internal processing
The way the camera processes the images is more important than it sounds. Even the best processing can't create miracles from a small sensor and cheap lens, but wrong processing can ruin the results from even the best hardware. (For years the exact processing routines are the best kept secret in the digital camera industry. Often, competing brands use essentially the same sensor and similar lens in competing models and good processing is the only way to have an edge with the image quality)


From what we see in the samples, Samsung G600 is the only camera, which scores particularly bad in this test - it oversharpens the images and that ruins the image for further editing. In the case of G600 the oversharpened also draws attention to the overexposed areas of the photos, by emphasizing the edge around these areas. 
You also get excessive amount of jagged diagonal lines, also known as a "staircase" effect. Overall, the images by G600 look a lot more like what we expect from photos taken by a phone, than the competitors.
Nokia N95 8GB uses an effective noise suppression technique. The main difference we see comparing it to the N95 classic is that the noise suppression was tuned down and now it's a lot harder to find example of a photo, where some detail is lost because of the noise processing. Have in mind that this has also been fixed in the N95 classic with one of the latest firmware updates.

ADVERTISEMENTS








Sony Ericsson K850 also uses noise suppression routine, but it is less intelligent than the one of N95 and in certain places it simply eradicates the really fine details. You can see how much details are sometimes lost in our G800 review. The noise suppression algorithm also sometimes has a problem with the edge detection thus removing significant amount of detail in low contrast areas of the image.
LG Viewty just processes the images "less" than the contenders. You can see more noise in the shadow areas and the images don't have the "punch" N95 images have. This approach however is best if you plan to edit the images on the computer later, but we are not quite sure how much of the cameraphone owners do this.
If Samsung G800 was participating in this test, it would have deserved a sure 10 as in our opinion the processing there is just right. 
Samsung G600: 2/10 • LG Viewty: 6/10 • Nokia N95 8GB: 8/10 • Sony Ericsson K850: 5/10
